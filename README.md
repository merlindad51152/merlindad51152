I am a novice computer user. I have experience using BASIC, as I was an Aerospace Fluid Power Technician. BASIC was utilizied for interacting with Hewlett Packard digital hardware which was used for automated testing of flight hardware. 
I was respondsible for writing the code respective to the spec required by a customer. However, I have been retired for many years and the ability to write code is long gone. I spend much of time using a pc to interact with the gaming world,
plus other tasks that get me through various chores, in my day to day activities. 

I decided that it was time for me to quit trolling GitHub without an account. Numerous times in the past I would venture into the site in search of some directional clarification of an answer to a question that I was entertaining.

NOTE: I was a technical writer of extensive, in depth reports which detailed the results of testing according to the MILSPEC requirements that a customer dictated. Any and all code that was utilized for testing was usually mandated to be included
in the required report(s). Without the incorporation of automation, many tests would have required months and in rare cases, years to complete!

Suffice it to say, when ever I notice an aircraft I shall say to myself: "I sure hope that if any of the hardware in that airframe is a component which I validated, is working correctly because a smoking hole at the site of a crash, is nothing
that I ever want to be part of." I accepted that after spending nearly nine years in the USAF maintaining the fluid power systems on fighters. During all of that tenure, no aircraft were lost due to a failure in my area of responsibility. 

Therfore, I believe that I have enabled another source of information, which has always been a huge part of my Life.
